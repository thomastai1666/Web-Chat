# Web-Chat
Basic web chat application built with Node.JS and Express

The objective of this project was to design a web chat that could be accessed in the web browser. I created a application using Node.JS as my server framework and Socket.IO to manage the client network layer. The client runs in most modern web browsers, since it is written in HTML, Javascript, and CSS. The application is designed with multiple types of chats in mind: private messaging, group conversations, and a global chat. 

To run this chat, install node.js and type “node index.js” in the terminal.
